# pytest.ini
# ==========
# This configuration file defines custom markers and Pytest options
# for the Selenium Pytest framework.
#
# Markers are used to group tests logically (smoke, regression, flow, negative)
# and control test selection and ordering during execution.
#
# Typical usage:
# --------------
# Run all smoke tests:
#   pytest -m smoke
#
# Run all regression tests:
#   pytest -m regression
#
# Run critical flow tests only:
#   pytest -m critical
#
# Run tests in a specific order:
#   pytest --disable-warnings

[pytest]
markers =
    smoke: Basic smoke tests
